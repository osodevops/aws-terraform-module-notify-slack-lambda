# aws-terraform-module-notify-slack-lambda

This project is part of our open source DevSecOps adoption approach. 

It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).

This module deploys and configures an SNS topic (or uses an existing one) and an AWS Lambda function that sends notifications to Slack using the [incoming webhooks API](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks).

Start by setting up an [incoming webhook integration](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/) in your Slack workspace.

## Solution Diagram

A diagram of the solution can be seen below: 
![solution-diagram](solution-diagram.png)

## Features

- [x] AWS Lambda runtime Python 3.8
- [x] Create new SNS topic or use existing one
- [x] Support plaintext and encrypted version of Slack webhook URL
- [x] Most of Slack message options are customizable
- [x] Support different types of SNS messages:
  - [x] AWS CloudWatch Alarms
  - [x] AWS CloudWatch LogMetrics Alarms
- [x] Local pytest driven testing of the lambda to a Slack sandbox channel

## Usage

```hcl
module "notify_slack" {
  source  = "github.com/osodevops/aws-terraform-module-notify-slack-lambda"

  sns_topic_name    = "slack-topic"

  slack_webhook_url = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/AAA/BBB/CCC"
  slack_channel     = "aws-notification"
  slack_username    = "reporter"
}
```

## Terraform versions

This module uses Terraform 0.13.

This module uses [Terraform AWS Lambda module](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-lambda) to handle most of heavy-lifting related to Lambda packaging, roles, and permissions, while maintaining the same interface for the user of this module after many of resources will be recreated.

## Use existing SNS topic or create new

If you want to subscribe the AWS Lambda Function created by this module to an existing SNS topic you should specify `create_sns_topic = false` as an argument and specify the name of existing SNS topic name in `sns_topic_name`.

## Examples

* [notify-slack-simple](https://github.com/osodevops/aws-terraform-module-notify-slack-lambda/tree/main/examples/notify-slack-simple) - Creates SNS topic which sends messages to Slack channel.
* [cloudwatch-alerts-to-slack](https://github.com/osodevops/aws-terraform-module-notify-slack-lambda/tree/main/examples/cloudwatch-alerts-to-slack) - End to end example which shows how to send AWS Cloudwatch alerts to Slack channel and use KMS to encrypt webhook URL.

## Testing with pytest

To run the tests:

1. Set up a dedicated slack channel as a test sandbox with it's own webhook. See [Slack Incoming Webhooks docs](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) for details.
2. Make a copy of the sample pytest configuration and edit as needed.

        cp functions/pytest.ini.sample functions/pytest.ini

3. Run the tests:

        pytest functions/notify_slack_test.py
